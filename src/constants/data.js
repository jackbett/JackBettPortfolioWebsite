    "Watkins Glen is a perfect destination for a day trip, with many opportunities for exploration. The village sits at the base of Seneca Lake and has many hiking trails, one of my favorites being the State Park. Walking the trail is easy due to well-maintained pathways and stairs while navigating throughout the gorge. Being able to see the waterfalls and streams created by glaciers is something I will never get tired of.",
